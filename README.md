Project Overview: Online Banking System

The **Online Banking System** is a Java-based web application designed to manage fundamental banking functionalities. This project allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts, such as viewing transaction history, updating profiles, and interacting with the banking system through a secure web interface. 

This system leverages **Java Servlets**, **JSP**, **JDBC**, and **MySQL** for backend operations, while the frontend is enhanced with **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**. Each component is organized into a modular structure, promoting clear separation between business logic, data access, and presentation layers. 

The primary objective of the project is to offer a user-friendly platform for essential banking services while adhering to a maintainable, scalable, and secure codebase. It includes stages for database setup, user interface design, server-side programming, and testing, with an emphasis on usability and robust data management.

### Key Features

1. **User Registration & Authentication**:
   - Users can register a new account and log in securely.
   - Login and session management are implemented to protect sensitive data.

2. **Account Management**:
   - Users can view account details, update their profiles, and access transaction history.

3. **Database Integration**:
   - MySQL database is used to manage users, accounts, and transaction data.
   - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are handled by DAO (Data Access Object) classes.

4. **Front-End Design**:
   - Clean and responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
   - JavaScript is used for form validation and interactivity.

5. **Security**:
   - Passwords are securely managed, and sessions are used to protect user information.
   - Error handling and input validation to prevent SQL injection and other vulnerabilities.

6. **Testing & Documentation**:
   - Unit tests for database operations are implemented using JUnit.
   - Comprehensive project documentation is provided, including setup instructions and code explanations.

### **Project Workflow**

The development process is organized into four main stages:

1. **Project Setup and Database Configuration**: 
   - Setting up the project structure and configuring database connectivity.

2. **Frontend Development**: 
   - Designing and styling the user interface for registration, login, and account management.

3. **Backend Development**: 
   - Implementing Servlets, handling HTTP requests, and integrating JSP for dynamic content.

4. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Writing unit tests, reviewing the entire project, and preparing documentation for users and developers.

### **Potential Use Cases**

- A basic online banking system for educational or demonstration purposes.
- A foundation for a more extensive banking application with features like fund transfer, payment processing, and detailed transaction tracking.
- An example project for learning Java-based web development and understanding MVC architecture.
